## Description
The following application allows a user to take notes using Express. When a user goes to the following website Note Taker, the user can click on the "Get Started" button to create, view, save, and delete notes.

## Technologies
This application uses the following: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap, Node.js, Express, and UUID. This application was also deployed using Heroku.
## Experiences
Building this application was a neat experience. Being able to see the completed application was great because it felt like what a full-stack developer would be doing; it was nice to see the front-end and back-end working together. One fo the challenging parts of the activity was getting the DELETE request to work. I ended up using Google to research the particular problems I was having when trying to figure out how to get the DELETE request to work. This homework also helped me to better understand how the front-end and back-end work together.
